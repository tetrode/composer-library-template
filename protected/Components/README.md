Components
===

folder: /protected/Components

Classes in the /protected/Components folder orchestrate MVC architecture calls and can be called from public php files.
For example, index.php calls /protected/Components/MyComponent and starts it.
Examples of Abstract Classes, Interfaces and Traits are given (only) here.

You can create subfolders to structure your Components.
