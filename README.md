Composer Library Template
=========================

If you are trying to create a new PHP Composer library, whether it will be going to submitted to packagist.org or just in your Github account, this template of files will surely help you make the process a lot easier and faster.

Features
--------

* PSR-4 autoloading compliant structure
* Unit-Testing with PHPUnit
* Comprehensive Guides and tutorial
* Easy to use to any framework or even a plain php file


I encourage that you put more information on this readme file instead of leaving it as is. See [How to make a README file](http://www.darwinbiler.com/designing-and-making-the-readme-file-for-your-github-repository/) for more info.
